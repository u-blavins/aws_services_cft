# AWS Services CloudFormation Templates

This repo containing CloudFormation Templates for AWS Services. Rather than looking at all the different Properties of a service through AWS, provided templates will contain all properties associated to the service.

## Instructions
The hierarchy below shows how to find a CloudFormation template.
```
\templates
    \service
        \service.json
        \service.md
```
Select a service in templates and the `service.json` will contain the CloudFormation template. `service.md` will provide further information provided by AWS.

## Contributing
Pull requests are always welcome considering the scale of services. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss changes.
